# T-Drive Taxi Trajectory Reconstruction

1. T-Drive trajectory dataset contains a one-week trajectories of 10,357 taxis in Beijing. You can find the original dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pzaGZaboOdUxsw7l6hhJDdsH8ZqUeZXs/view?usp=sharing).

2. In this study we intend to use these trajectories to develop methods which can learn the sequence dependence between the positional coordinates of these trajectories, and then can be used to reconstruct the missing portions in trajectories.

3. To achieve this objective we have following work has been done so far:
